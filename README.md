# GraphicalRepresentationHalfLife
Choose an element and the amount of atoms for a graphical representation of it's radioactive decay over time. If it's a stable element, the code will say something like "Element is stable. Try another element." 

Make sure that you add the correct directory when reading the .csv file and the image of the radioactive elements. I took out my directory because my computer architecture is laid out differently then someone elses computer. 

Credit for the .csv file goes to : https://github.com/sweaver2112/periodic-table-data/blob/main/pTable.csv

Thank you!
